<p> Shrek first premiered theatrically on April 22, 2001 and has remained in the hearts of milennials ever since. The story follows an unlikely hero who gets tasked with saving a princess <br> from a fire breathing dragon and deliver her to the king, all with his unlikely side kick. If you think you have heard this story before, <mark> I promise you it will not measure close to this masterpiece. </mark> </p>
